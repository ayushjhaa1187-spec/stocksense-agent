## 2024-05-24 - Accessibility: Skip Links & Smooth Scroll
**Learning:** Adding a "Skip to main content" link and enabling smooth scrolling significantly improves keyboard navigation and overall user experience for users relying on assistive technologies or keyboard-only navigation. The skip link allows users to bypass repetitive header navigation, while smooth scrolling provides better visual context when jumping to sections.
**Action:** Ensure all future pages/layouts include a `<main>` landmark and a corresponding skip link. Standardize smooth scrolling for all anchor navigation.
