## 2026-02-19 - Skip to Main Content Link
**Learning:** For long-scrolling single-page layouts like this dashboard, keyboard users are forced to tab through every header link before reaching the content. A "Skip to main content" link is critical for accessibility, especially when the navigation is fixed or prominent.
**Action:** Always verify the presence of a "Skip to main content" link in header-heavy layouts and ensure smooth scrolling implementations respect `prefers-reduced-motion`.
