## 2024-05-23 - Skip to Main Content & Smooth Scrolling
**Learning:** "Skip to main content" links are often overlooked but are critical for keyboard users to bypass repetitive navigation. Implementing them requires semantic HTML structure (wrapping content in `<main>`) which benefits screen readers too. Smooth scrolling (`scroll-behavior: smooth`) drastically improves the feel of anchor navigation with a single line of CSS.
**Action:** Always check for skip links in new projects and ensure semantic HTML structure to support them. Verify anchor navigation feels smooth.
